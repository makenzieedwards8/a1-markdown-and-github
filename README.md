# Are Some COVID-19 Vaccines More Effective Than Others?

**COVID-19 vaccines** rolling out around the world weren't compared to each other in studies, so it's hard to tell how they might differ in effectiveness. Experts say the vaccines are alike on what matters most: _preventing hospitalizations and deaths._ The CDC urges people to get whatever vaccine they can.

> "Real-world evidence as millions of people receive the vaccines show they're all working very well. Still, people might wonder if one is better than another since studies conducted before the vaccines were rolled out found varying levels of effectiveness. The problem is they don't offer apples-to-apples comparisons." -[US News](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-04-08/are-some-covid-19-vaccines-more-effective-than-others)
